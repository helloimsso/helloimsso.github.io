  <li>
PREP AND MEASURE THE INGREDIENTS.
Gather all the ingredients to your workplace.</li>
<br> 
  <li>
MAKE THE DOUGH.
Mix water, yeast, sugar, salt and oil together until dissolved. Add in the flour and mix with a spatula just until incorporated. Cover the bowl with a warm wet cloth and let it sit at room temperature for about an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.</li>
<br> 
  <li>
MAKE THE FILLING.
Mix the sugar, chopped nuts and cinnamon together in a bowl. You can use any nuts that you like. I used a combination of almond and cashew. Set aside. </li>
<br> 
  <li>
PUNCH DOWN THE DOUGH FOR SECOND RISE.
This is what the dough looks like after the initial 1 hour rise. It will have doubled in size and will be very sticky. Punch down the dough using your hands or a spatula and let it rest again for another 20 minutes. </li>
<br> 
  <li>
KNEAD AND DIVIDE THE DOUGH.
Pour the sticky dough onto a floured surface and knead for a while with well floured hands until the dough comes together. Roll into a ball and cut in half and then cut each half into four smaller pieces, so you’ll end up with 8 pieces of dough. </li>
<br> 
  <li>
FILL THE DOUGH.
Again with floured hands take each ball of dough and pat it flat with your hand and fill the middle with a tablespoonful of the sugar mixture. Slightly push with the back of a spoon so the sugar sits nicely in the dough. </li>
<br> 
  <li> 
SEAL THE DOUGH POUCH.
Fold each end up and pinch slightly together so it seals shut.</li>
<br> 
  <li>
COOK THE HODDEOK.
In a well oiled cast iron skillet/griddle (or any pan if you don’t have one) pour in a little vegetable oil so there is a thin coating and heat on medium flame. Put the ball of dough pinched side down and cook for about 30 seconds until browned. </li>
<br> 
  <li>
FLIP AND PUSH DOWN GENTLY WITH A SPATULA
Flip over and carefully push the ball down into a flat pancake with the back of your spatula and cook for another minute. If it seems like you can’t flatten the ball anymore, don’t force it - you might have put in too much filling and the sugar will just burst out. </li>
<br> 
  <li> 
FLIP AND COOK THE OTHER SIDE.
Flip again and cover with a lid and cook for a minute until the sugar is nice and melted. Keep repeating the cooking steps until all the dough-balls are cooked. Stack them in a plate and serve right away.</li>
<br>

ENJOY! </li>
